hi i am zian ejaz from siakot paksitan.
i have completed my final project named zian's cs50 blog and i will briefly tell you about it.
it is a blog app made with html, css, bootstrap, javascript, flask and python in which anyone can register and post, idea is to provide basic newsfeed where everyone can communicate in the form of posts.
features of app include, user registration, user login, post, update post, delete post, update account information and update profile picture.
it was pleasure studing at harvard.
i love to speak "this is cs50"
