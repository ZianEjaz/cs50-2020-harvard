# cs50-2020-harvard
This repository to post my solutions to Harvard University's 2020 CS50 course assignments during the course.
Hope this is helpful to other students, you are free to contact me for any question or clarification, and if you don't mind please leave a star!
I am uploading these just for referance and it will be completely useless if you did not practice and just copy the assignments.

All the assignments are in order of their submission. for instance all submitions of problem set 2 are in folder pset2.
